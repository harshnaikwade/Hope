# Hope

‘Hope’ is a web-based application which will direct Transfusion Centers(TCs) and Hospitals to get blood from donors in case of emergency by posting required details and sending SMS (Short Message Service) alert to the registered donors.


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Architecture diagram explains how system works in real. There are four main components which are central database, users(donors and hospitals), server and Google Map API Services. The server will consist of database where data such as hospital and donor’s details, locations are stored at. Blood donation website will consist of the hospital login members and users like us who can register themselves and once registered, they become the donor member of our website. The website will be for the hospitals where they will be added by admin and the user_id and password will be given to the hospitals by the admin. Then the hospitals can post request for blood and also respond to user’s request. Users are able to see the location of hospital where blood is needed using internet through Google Map API. If donors want to donate blood, they can simply accept the request posted by hospitals and register for donation. Server stores all the information and provide it to the given central database.
